ZNW Bot / zBot Is a Discord.JS bot I spent a few months on as a project to learn Node.JS/Javascript. Super fun project but with slash commands being the new standard for bots, I've finally decided to stop and archive the project. It was mostly a fun bot with some moderation commands.

## Features
- Animal image commands
- Image search commands (Pixabay and Reddit)
- API-Based text responses (Like Would You Rather questions, Roasts, and OwOify)
- Typical moderation commands like ban, kick, and mute
- Anime reactions like Hug, Kiss, and Slap
- Utilities but Polls and Embed Generators

## Installation
Not sure why you'd want to install it, but here you go.
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
Then just install the dependencies and start.
```sh
npm install
node index.js
```
